# Kotlin Sandbox

I'll try various Kotlin syntax

## Description
### Scope Function
- `apply`
- `let`
- `run`
- `also`

#### apply
**Apply** refers to the context object as a lambda receiver â€“ by keyword `this`, which you can omit the kyeword.
This feature makes it ideal for changing value of object fields.

```kotlin
val child = Child("Rei", lastName = "Ayanami", id = 1)
            .apply {
                age = 14
                gender = Gender.FEMALE
            }
```

#### let
**Let** accesses the context object as a lambda argument.
If the argument name is not specified, the object is accessed by the implicit default name `it`.
`Let` returns the lambda result.

```kotlin
val child = Child("Shinji", "Ikari", 2)
            .let {
                it.age = 14
                it.gender = Gender.MALE
                it
            }
```

#### Run
**Run** refers to the context object as a lambda receiver same as `apply` function.
