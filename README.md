# Kotlin Sandbox

I'll try various Kotlin syntax

## Description
### Scope Function
- `apply`
- `let`
- `run`
- `also`

#### apply
**Apply** refers to the context object as a lambda receiver â€“ by keyword `this`, which you can omit the kyeword.
This feature makes it ideal for changing value of object fields.

```kotlin
val child = Child("Rei", lastName = "Ayanami", id = 1)
            .apply {
                age = 14
                gender = Gender.FEMALE
            }
```
